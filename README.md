# fly.io Gossip Glomers challenges

This is a log of my work to solve the various Gossip Glomers challenges published by fly.io over at https://fly.io/dist-sys/.

They are a really great set of challenges and gave me some good experience working with Jepsen testing and it's approach to semi-formal verification of solutions.

They also serve as an example of separating the business logic of distributed systems from the underlying transports and protocols which allows things like fault injection and other interesting behaviors to be injected by a verification framework.
